####### GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CONFIG #######
#
# This config file allows you to specify a number of important pieces of information that
# the THE_Aligner pipeline will require to run. It also allows you to set optional parameters
# for all tools that THE_Aligner makes use of.
#
# File paths can either be absolute (e.g., ~/path/to/file/or/directory) or relative
# to the directory in which you are calling the pipeline from (e.g., data/fastq/WT_1 in the 
# example samples entry means to look in the data directory present in the directory
# where you called `snakemake` to run the pipeline).
#
####### PARAMETERS YOU NEED TO SET #######


# Path to annotation file
annotation: "data/annotation/genome.gtf"


# Path to genome fasta file
genome: data/genome/genome.fasta 


# Path to fastq file to inspire simulated data
read_1: "data/WT1/WT1_test_R1.fastq.gz"


# Path to second read in pair if using paired-end fastq as input
  # Empty string if using single-end fastq as input
read_2: ""


# Number of replicates to simulate
number_of_replicates: 3


# Total number of reads to simulate in each sample
library_size: 10000


# q-score ASCII value to imput
qscore_impute: "I"

# Path to Salmon indices
  # Will be created at this directory if not already present
indices: "indices/"


# Strandedness
  # set to "reverse", "yes", or "no"
  # reverse means that read 2 represents 5' to 3' sequence of original RNA (read 1 thus represents its reverse complement)
  # yes means that read 1 represents 5' to 3' sequence of original RNA
  # no means unstranded
strandedness: "reverse"


# Directionality
  # Do reads face inwards ("I"), outwards ("O"), or do they match ("M")
  # Currently only used to determine Salmon library type
directionality: "I"



####### OPTIONAL PARAMETERS FOR EACH TOOL USED #######


##### PARAMETERS MOST WORTH DOUBLE CHECKING #####

# Adapters to pass to fastp 
  # Not strictly necessary as fastp can autodetect. Autodetection is more accurate for paired-end data
  # For paired-end data with widely used Illumina TruSeq adapters, this could be: 
  # "--adapter_sequence AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2 AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT"
fastp_adapters: ""



##### PARAMETERS FOR CUSTOM SIMULATION R SCRIPTS

# Extra parameters for modifying the provided annotation prior to quantification
modify_annotation_params: ""
