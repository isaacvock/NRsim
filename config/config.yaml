####### GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CONFIG #######
#
# This config file allows you to specify a number of important pieces of information that
# the NRsim pipeline will require to run. It also allows you to set optional parameters
# for all tools that NRsim makes use of.
#
# File paths can either be absolute (e.g., ~/path/to/file/or/directory) or relative
# to the directory in which you are calling the pipeline from (e.g., data/fastq/WT_1 in the 
# example samples entry means to look in the data directory present in the directory
# where you called `snakemake` to run the pipeline).
#
# Paths to files and directories are wrapped in double quotes in this example config, though
# this is technically not necessary, as Snakemake typically knows to interpret them as strings
# whether or not the double quotes are present.
####### PARAMETERS YOU NEED TO SET #######

### Files to create annotation and read counts for simulation

# Path to annotation file
annotation: "path/to/annotation.gtf"


# Path to genome fasta file
genome: "data/genome/genome.fasta"


# Path to fastq file to inspire simulated data
read_1: "path/to/read_1.fastq"


# Path to second read in pair if using paired-end fastq as input
  # Empty string if using single-end fastq as input
read_2: ""


### Key simulation details

# Simulate paired-end data?
  # All simulated libraries must be either SE or PE, even in the
  # multi-dataset simulation case.
PE: True


# Number of replicates to simulate
  # All simulated libraries must have the same number of replicates,
  # even in the multi-dataset simulation case.
number_of_replicates: 3


# Total number of reads to simulate in each sample
library_size: 10000000


# q-score ASCII value to imput
qscore_impute: "I"

# s4U labeled RNA read mutation rate
s4U_mutation_rate: 0.05


# OPTIONAL: For if you want simulate multiple different datasets 
# with different simulation parameters. Give each dataset a keyword name
# (e.g., sim1) and provide a value for each parameter value for each dataset.
simulation_parameters: 
  library_size:
    sim_1: 10000000
    sim_2: 20000000
  qscore_impute:
    sim_1: "I"
    sim_2: "I"
  s4U_mutation_rate:
    sim_1: 0.05
    sim_2: 0.1
  extra_params:
    sim_1: ""
    sim_2: ""


### Salmon parameters to get transcript abundances for simulation

# Path to Salmon indices
  # Will be created at this directory if not already present
indices: "indices/"


# Strandedness
  # set to "reverse", "yes", or "no"
  # reverse means that read 2 represents 5' to 3' sequence of original RNA (read 1 thus represents its reverse complement)
  # yes means that read 1 represents 5' to 3' sequence of original RNA
  # no means unstranded
strandedness: "reverse"


# Directionality
  # Do reads face inwards ("I"), outwards ("O"), or do they match ("M")
  # Currently only used to determine Salmon library type
directionality: "I"



####### OPTIONAL PARAMETERS FOR EACH TOOL USED #######


##### PARAMETERS MOST WORTH DOUBLE CHECKING #####

# Adapters to pass to fastp 
  # Not strictly necessary as fastp can autodetect. Autodetection is more accurate for paired-end data
  # For paired-end data with widely used Illumina TruSeq adapters, this could be: 
  # "--adapter_sequence AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA --adapter_sequence_r2 AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT"
fastp_adapters: ""
